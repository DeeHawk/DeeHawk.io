      <P> A favorite pastime of many scientists, engineers, IT professionals and 
        content creators is building one’s own compute.These computers sometimes referred to as “Battlestations”, 
        represent a significant time and monetary investment. 
        There are many types of components to select from and a person new to the hobby can often 
        feel confused on what parts to buy.</p>
        The recommender system that aggregates user data from veteran users and recommend complete 
        PC builds that will help guide new PC enthusiast. Our tool will recommends a list of PC components 
        to purchased based on a certain criteria provided by the user. </P>
    <p> Currently, there does not appear to be a implementation of our idea or it is not well advertised by 
        the PC building community.There are many components to select from, a product line will often have 
        Compatibility with different PC components can be a significant technical challenge. Aggregating builds 
        that are already complete removes this challenge from the user.There are many components to select from,

      <P> In this project we the techonoly Python as well as NTLK library for web scrapping. Content-based and Collaborative-based 
        filtering used to create recommendations. The recommender sytem utilizes the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/"> PCPartPicker</a> website 
        for data retrieval.As a subtask for information extraction Named-entity Recognition (NER) technology has been used 
        to find entity elements from raw data and can determine the category in which the clients/users query belongs.To highlights the important 
        entity elements in the text from  user dataset placed in Parse Tree with chunking and POS tagging methods. Detail
        techniques and illustration of the project will be found in this

    <P>the plans towards the recommender system to better expressive way to parse the entities
       by removing unwanted or unuseful data. Also to include web scrapping dynamic content to make the
      system much robust. There is also future plan to integrate price in the reommendion.
